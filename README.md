# PurgeKernels
Python3 script to purge obsolete kernels from Ubuntu OS.

It's a well known problem with Ubuntu OS that old kernel modules do not get purged when the kernel gets updated, and may clutter up for years.

This script provides a controlled way to check which kernel versions are installed, which can be purged, and, if necessary, perform the purging effectively after a user consent is given.

Usage:
`python3 PurgeKernels.py`

No options are supported and none is needed.
